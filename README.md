# Scripts

Place to keep (most of) my scripts that I've created (or sometimes borrowed and
improved, in which I try to comment about and reference original sources)

## Purpose

testing, creating, sharing my scripts for future generations...

## Description

there are multiple scripts within this repo.
i try to keep them organized by function/infrastructure.

## Directory Structure

 - `aws`      : AWS specific scripts
 - `chef`     : Chef/Knife specific scripts
 - `learning` : scripts used for learning purposes
 - `misc`     : miscellaneous scripts that don't fit the other categories
 - `oldschool`: really old scripts (for posterity and to laugh at myself)
 - `openstack`: OpenStack specific scripts
 - `r5s`      : scripts created strictly for Red 5 Studios
 - `stacker`  : stacker lookups
 - `testing`  : scripts that are still WIP and being tested

## Scripts

TODO: Here's a list of highlighted scripts that I'm a little more proud of and
general info about them.

| Script | Description | Type | Status |
|---------|-------------|:----:|:------:|
| script 1 | description for script 1 | bash | WIP |
| script 2 | description for script 2 | python | Done |
