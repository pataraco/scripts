Tech N9ne
(feat. Ceza, Jl B.Hood, Uso, Yelawolf, Twista, Busta Rhymes, D-Loc, Twisted Insane)

[Ceza (Turkey):]
Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir (Get up, get your microphone)
Bak jak burada mikrofonuna tak (Look, here is the jack, connect your mic)
Kağıt kalem bir de ilham alınacak (And here is the paper and the pen, we're gonna get inspired)
Tam gaz choppers, havada düşman avına çıkalım (No stop Choppers are in the air, Let's hunt enemies)
Akalım, haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım (Let's go, let's win this battle)

(We started in the Midwest)
(Now we 'bout to take it)
(All over the world, baby!)
(This is the pinnacle!)
(Yeah, Tech N9ne!)

[Tech N9ne]
Follow me, all around the planet, I run the gamut on Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage wit' no apology
Pick 'em off the planet, got little manic 'cause I gotta be
Frantic, I'ma jam it 'cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at my mama nakas
I could pop at you, proper, 'cause I'm partners wit' Waka Flocka
Gimme the top of hip-hop and watch 'em make 'em rock
With a show-stopper, chakras poppin' off the (Worldwide Choppers)
If you anybody, you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul as it
Loaded cold as the polar get, wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo, when exploded, the flow behold it, 'cause when that motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Gimme the knock and I'ma chop it, he came and he went tomorrow
But I'ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas

Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trippin' when I rip it, I be the X when I split 'em up
Sorta like I was liquored up and backin' up in the gut
Everybody be knowin' I be actin' up when I buzz
From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss, fuck anybody, Tech is calamitous
Leave 'em in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standin' up

Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You wit' it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin' he give it to Poe and toss to Picasso
Killin' everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

[Hook]
I'm light years
Ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me
Don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

(K.C.)

[J.L.]
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em, chop it up with the veteran
A legend developin', they gotta tell 'em it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant, none of you niggas relevant'
You delicate, I'm lovin' every second of this

(Denmark)

[Uso - Translation in brackets]
De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det (They will all check it when we lay it)
Kommer ind og smækker det beatet jeg vækker det (coming in and smashing it beatet I'm waking it)
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund (you know whats coming out of my mouth)
Hanger med de vildeste gutter (hanging with the coolest guys)
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af (it reminds me we stepping it (set on fire))
For de kalder mig alle vild worldwide chopper (cause they all call me wild worldwide chopper)

(Alabama)

[Yelawolf]
What if I ran into you wit' a Pogo stick?
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness?
Wit' a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playin' Hamlet?
Syllable burnin', that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peelin' pecans
But instead, I'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sam-a-wich
Pick up a 22. and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucker from Westside, a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make 'em feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had dead shocks,
But I hopped on the fuckin' beat and I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck wit' Tech N9ne, twist up the pine
And smoke a beat wit' Mr. Busta Rhymes, well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat wit' the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throat
Wit' an alien probe

[Twista]
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm
Or loosen the venom and hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemy 'cause of cannibalism
Breakin' 'em off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible 'cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then ya respect a better habit
'Cause I'm an anomaly, able to give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy
Hoppin' out, I don't stop what that follows when the flame's thrown
Now one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there
We W-W-C, if you can't keep up, shoulda stayed home
My-my-my alien knowledge be makin' other astronomers
Welcome this angel as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'ma be shinin' on them haters
I'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Or even try to stop us 'cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

(New York)

[Busta Rhymes]
See how they ask when I'ma stomp on my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and what I'ma drop on my dude
Inevitably, is that I'ma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “What in the world is you provin'?
What, when you already the best? And what the hell is he doin'?”
Well, I'ma be choppin' and cuttin' and breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
And fuckin' everything up 'til there ain't no further mistakin'
And bustin' everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shuttin' everything up, 'specially the ones who be hatin'
They lovin' everything until I got 'em stutterin' stupid
You hear 'em now? “D-d-d-d-don't do-do-do-do it!
P-P-P-Please? Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest!”
And now I'ma come and kill 'em, get 'em, hit 'em, and finish 'em
And bang 'em in the head and diminish 'em, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, creepin' comin' to kill 'em
Then he be gotta be drillin' 'em, thinkin' “They gotta be feelin' 'em!”
Spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em?
And gettin' 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin' 'em?
Hopin' you're listenin' and you're payin' attention
And you're witnessin' the way that I be crushin' on the mic
And gettin' in the zone, I be flattenin' and packin' in
People from the front to the back and
They got me actin' a fool, I'm blackin', nigga
Now I'm home!

[D-Loc]
Like fire annihilate me father retire instantly
I'm choppin'em, call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killin' 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Yela will finish and end any predicament
And the enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get wit' me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal, more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they say that your boy's biblical

(California)

[Twisted Insane]
I hit 'em wit venom and get up in 'em
I bend 'em and send 'em and you can feel me
Diggin' up in your brain and bringin' the pain, and y'all fin' wanna kill me
Fillin' 'em with that fury, get up and hurry, you can feel the real me
Comin' in wit' that shit, I'm havin' a fit, and you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
You been poppin' off, I'ma hit 'em up wit' a bullet to the (Brain!)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathin', you're fiendin'
And dreamin' to find a demon name Insane, I'm a worldwide (Chopper)
